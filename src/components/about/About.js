                An open letter, to the universe
                Dear Mr. Universe,

                How are you? I am writing, to express my gratitude. You’ve been kind, and I am thankful. Looking back, I realised how fine life has been to me. I’ve experienced all that is good on the earth.

                I’ve loved my parents, my brother, my friends, a beautiful girl, a lovely kid and I’ve been loved back. What a joy it is. Sometimes, I’ve been kind to strangers and strangers have been kind to me – genuine compassion – I don’t have the writing ability to express the satisfaction of this emotion.

            </p>

            <p>The mission is to bring in “The great Indian coding renaissance” and PepCoding is the flag, under which I’ll take the battle for this cause. I’ll make sure nothing else will matter but this cause. I’ll not let money, health, motivation become roadblocks - I’ll not let roadblocks be roadblocks. I am just glad; I got to fight for it. This is my fight and I’ll gladly take the wins and the losses; scars and the medals; heartbreaks, jubilations and the tribulations along the way. This is the only way I could live, a life of mission.


                Here is what me and PepCoding have setup on achieving

                To bring in The Great Indian Coding Renaissance
                I’ve kept a single goal declaration to not let the emphasis be scattered, but a goal can never be clearly expressed without clearly defined and measurable metrics. Here are a few metrics we will hold ourselves against

                Our students becoming smart enough to be coveted by the best IT firms – the Microsofts, Apples, Google, Facebooks, Oracles and Amazons - across India and globe.
                Our students becoming smart enough to win the best coding competitions world – ICPC, Codejams and Hackercups.
                Our students ushering in the next wave of Indian start-ups – I’ll wish to believe that my students have enough raw talent to one day build companies like Googles and Microsofts, and I’ve enough talent to teach them the self-belief which will take them there.
                It doesn’t matter whether the above will take 1 year, 5 years, 10 years or the entire life. I’ll love to die on my work-desk working for the goals and metrics mentioned above.

                Thanks,

                Sumeet Malik</p>
